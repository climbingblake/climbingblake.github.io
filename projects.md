## Non-climbing

[BadBolts.com](http://badbolts.com) of course. The first and only national bolt database for crowd sourcing rusted/worn climbing anchors, and getting that information to developers.  Currently in use in 15 US states, and currently in talks internationally.

[RouteHistory.com](http://RouteHistory.com) A startup project to record and archive stories about and around climbing routes. How they got their name, epics, and just funny stories.  These stories are continually being removed from guidebooks and this be a single portal for this type of climbing history.

[Sendex.Report](http://Sendex.report) Currently just demo data, but will be the home of an open-source project for precise climbing conditions.

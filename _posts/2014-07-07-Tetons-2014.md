Recently your [American Alpine Club](http://www.americanalpineclub.org) had its yearly employee meeting at the [Grand Teton Climbers Ranch](http://americanalpineclub.org/p/grand_teton_climbers_ranch)
As the AAC is one of my contracting clients, I was invited to attend, work at the ranch, meet the rest of the group, and even enjoy the views.

The weather was amazing. As I am not a snow-goer, I opted out of climbing and camping in the saddle, but it was reported that the weather was so good, that the climbers camped outside of the shelter, under a perfectly clear sky, with the full moon and zero wind. Kinda wish I had humped it up there for that.

Not everyone that attended, but a few of us that didnt want to leave.
Did I mention perfect weather?

During the long days since Sept 26, the day of my accident, progess has been made for both by broken arm, as well as my fractured back.

Starting to feel a bit stronger, and to start the new year on with a new outlook, I asked Rachel Goldman at [Bella Henna](http://bellahenna.com) of Cincinnati OH, for a henna design "cover up" of my arm scar where a titanium plate was installed.

Not only was the process theraputic, and awesome to watch a talented artist at work, but the outcome was much more than I expected. The design is sacred geometry with evil eye for protection, and ward off evil for the coming year.

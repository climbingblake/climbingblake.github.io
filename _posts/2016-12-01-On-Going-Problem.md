## Ground Prevention

Being lowered off the end of a rope is still an issue for climbers. I can understand that with the increasing number of
people participating in rock climbing that this could increase the statistics, but it seems that it is still a growing number.

## Close the System

- Tie a knot in the end of the rope, everytime
- Know your equipment
- Tie your rope to a rope bag
- Know your climb/environment/route/lowering plan
- Tie the rope to your belayer (with a proper climbing knot)

Check out my previous post on my accident and how I failed to prevent it
